# The Know Soft Character Builder

#### The Know Soft Character Builder is a Ruby based web app designed to allow users to create and modify characters for the world of Cyberpunk, created by Mike Pondsmith. Characters have several attributes, to tell us a little about who the characters are that can be added and modified by the user who created them:

* Name
* Hometown
* Skill
* Iconic_item

## Installation
1. Fork and clone the project files found here: https://github.com/Carlj0666/know_soft_char_build
2. Run the app in your favorite local developer environment
3. Install needed gems including: bundle install, and gem install corneal
4. In your terminal, type and run shotgun
5. CMD + click on the http://127.0.0.1:9393/ link to open the web app.

## Contribution
Potential areas of expansion of the Know Soft Character Builder should be functional, stable and adhere to the security measures written into the first version. Adding additional character attributes, associated artwork and styling are all welcome, but should be in keeping with the slightly retro looking cyberpunk genre aesthetic and language. Please contact me to review any art you would like to use before including it.
